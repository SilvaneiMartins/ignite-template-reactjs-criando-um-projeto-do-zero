### 🚧About the Challenge... 🚧

In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS. This will be an application where your main objective is to create a blog from scratch. You will receive a practically blank application that must consume Prismic data and have the interface implemented according to Figma's layout. You will have access to several files to deploy.

Next, we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done.🚀
